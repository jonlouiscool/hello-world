In looking at XML i found for my final project i found that i needed to store amounts of different data and sources all over the web
Alot of people over the years have look at gaming and profit for each part. 
However using transcribing data in exercise one would not help with the overall end goal of my idea
Due to not having to change data over into something different or more readable. 

Failure for myself
Learning how to use XML could be useful for learning about older documents or digitalizing data from books for the future.
If my project were more in digitalizing old history i would love to use this platform for more work.
