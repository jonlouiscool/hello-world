In Module 4 Exercise 2:
Essentially, I had to allow the program to create the number of topics I picked. 
I picked 10 topics which is the default, and i ran into a problem
Basically, the program was not creating a new file because i did not divide the tool and CND file from my downloads and other folders.
After dividing the program and CND file from my other documents, the HTML file was easily located and the program divided the topics.
In looking at the HTML the following topics:
1. general men inidans arrived st received west inform for extract
2. south miles colony river governor wales cape land company colonial
3.	man time island people port called good natives crew short
4.	country house time state place government give made considerable large
5.	states united british kingdom americans american inform war great state
6.	captain king vessel chief people immediately son board voyage regiment
7.	mr present public made committee bill subject gentlemen meeting lord
8.	mr town long england young children ship passengers day letter
9.	country emigration great trade canada land upper labour part make
10.	number years ditto persons government emigrants june settlers good society

The topics shown are what the program output to me after I imput the number of topics.
