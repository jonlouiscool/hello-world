I had made a pull request at the beginning of the semester.

##Why am I here?

 When experiencing digital history, I personally was interested in learning what more can technology and history do together.
 Data mining to me seems to intergrat that idea of combining technology with history,
 to allow people to connect to the past and keep the past relevant. 

#What do I want to achieve in taking Hist3907?

I would like to be able to combine my law background with new ways to research and find information.
Essentially, combining technology with law on order to be able to use case studies more affectivily.

In addition, I enjoy the teachings of Dr. Graham and I hope to learn well from his work in this course.
